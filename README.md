# machine-learning
This is to learn machine learning by teaching a machine to learn. It uses Python(3.12.7) along with Jupyter Notebook for better readability and reproducibility.

This project uses Anaconda(2024.10-1) for isolating machine learning packages from other python packages in a virtual environment.

Create an environment named machine-learning and install torch and jupyterlab package using native conda package manager.

Link to download Python 3.12.7: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3127/

Link to download Anaconda 2024.10-1: https://www.anaconda.com/download/

Steps to install tensor flow:
-   Download and install Anaconda(add anaconda to environment path for access from command line)
-   Use "conda create -n machine-learning pytorch torchvision python=3.12.7 anaconda" to create a virtual environment
-   Navigate to the project folder and use "activate machine-learning" to activate the virtual environment
-   You are done, Happy learning.
